# Conflict Agreement

## What will our group do if we encounter a conflict?
If there is a major malfunction we'll speak as a group and if needed put it up to a vote.

## How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
We'll bring any issues like that up as a group and use "I feel..." statements to exercise empathy.

## What is your process to resolve conflicts?
Empathy, equality, and transparency. We will work through issues together with open communication.

## How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
If we have brought the issue up as a group and have not been able to resolve it, we will then bring in an outside person to help us.
